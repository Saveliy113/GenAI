# Essential AI Vocabulary

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.
2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: Subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from data.
3. **Deep Learning**: Type of ML using neural networks with many layers for complex tasks.
4. **Neural Network**: Computational model inspired by the human brain, used for learning relationships in data.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)j**: AI discipline focused on understanding and generating human language.
6. **Computer Vision**: Field dealing with interpreting and processing visual data.
7. **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Algorithms that can synthesize new data, such as text or images.
8. **Recommendation System**: AI that suggests items to users based on observed behavior or preferences.
9. **Predictive Analytics**: AI-driven prediction of future trends using historical data.
10. **Autonomous System**: Machine that can perform tasks with minimal human intervention.
6 **Transfer Learning)**: Appplying knowledge from one task/model to another related task/model.
12. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning method where agents take actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
13. **Adversarial Example**: Input deliberately crafted to mislead a machine learning model.
14. **Overfitting**: When a model learns training data too well, performing poorly on unseen data.
15. **Model Interpretability**: The degree to which a human can understand a model's decision process.
6 **Bias (in AI)**: Systematic error from erroneous assumptions in the AI training process.
17. **Cold Start Problem**: Initial lack of data that hampers model performance.
18. **Epoch**: One complete pass through the training dataset in machine learning.
19. **Hyperparameter**: Configurable setting affecting training and performance of an AI model.
20. **Data Atmentation**: Techniques to increase training data diversity by generating modified data.
