# AI Applications: Research Overview

## 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)NLP enables machines to understand and generate human language, delivering immense business value by automating text and speech analysis, hancing customer support, and enabling real-time translation. Technical challenges often include context interpretation, handling ambiguous phrasing, and scaling models while respecting privacy. Weak points incolve bias in training data and potential for misunderstanding complex expressions.
